# Auto LLM

This is an experimental project to automate the usage of a PC using LLMs (Large Language Models) like GPT-3. The idea is to use the LLM to automate the usage of a PC, for example, to automatically change the wallpaper, open a program, or even write code.

## How it works

The project is divided into two parts: the LLM and the automation. The LLM is responsible for understanding the user's commands and generating the necessary code to automate the PC. The automation part is responsible for executing the code generated by the LLM.

## How to use

> [!Note]
> <sup><strong>Please use Powershell so that the Automation part of Auto-LLM can run the commands.</strong></sup>

First, please export the following environment variables:

```powershell
# So that the python script doesn't crash
$env:PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
```

After that, you can run the following commands:

```bash
# Init Venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Run the main script
python3 src/main.py
```
